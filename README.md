## Data Analysis

* There was very weak correlation between latitude and cloudiness in the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. This is because the r values for these graphs are very close to zero. Hence, illustrating there is no correlation. The data shows the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of the year than the northern hemisphere. This could be due to the tilt of the earth at the time of the year the data was gathered.

* There was a weak negative correlation between latitude and max temperature in the Northern Hemisphere, and there was a strong positive correlation between latitude and max temperature in the Southern Hemisphere. The southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere. This may be due to the tilt of the earth at the time of the year this data was gathered.

* There was very weak correlation between latitude and humidity in the Northern Hemisphere and in the Southern Hemisphere. From the general data, the weather becomes siginificantly warmer as we approach the equator. This could be due to the tilt of the earth at the time of the year the data was gathered.
